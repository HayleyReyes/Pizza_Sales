```
### Findings/Results
 - We found that peak sales times were 1 p.m and 7 p.m of the locations
 - The average order value is $102.88
 - Item Pizza Quattro Formation has the highest sales and is the most popular by demand
 - Highest sales location is located in Central Manchester
 - We were able to determine remaining stock of ingredients along with cost
 - Staffing suggestions and total staffing costs

### Recommmendations
Based on our findings, it is recommended to:
 - Invest in marketing and promotions during the peak sales hours. Also to add promotions during outside of peak time to increase revenue
 - Focus on expanding and promoting top sale items (Pizza Quattro Formation and Pizza Daviola)
### Limitations 
 - N/A
